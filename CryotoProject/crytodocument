Welcome to Crypto.
This program focuses on the use of parameters
in passing variables from method to method in order to
get the desired output.
In our main method, we will need to user to input the string of
text they would like encrypted as well as the shift value and
group value for future methods.
Our first method will be our normalize text method.
This will turn all of the characters uppercase and
remove any punctuation and white space from the line of text and
return a string.
Our next method will be called obify.
This will take in the normalized text and insert a capital O and
capital B in front of every vowel, including y, and
return the obify text.
Next, we will have our caesarify method.
This method will take every letter individually and
shift it down the alphabet a set number of times.
For example, if our set number was three and our text was dog,
it would become F-R-J instead of D-O-G.
The function shift alphabet has been proved for
you which does all the shifting for you.
This method, again, will return the code that has been shifted.
The next method is called groopify
which will chunk the code into user stated sized chunks.
In order to do this, we'll be inserting white space
after a certain number of characters.
In case the text you have is not evenly divisible by the group
size, you'll need to add in some buffer at the end of the code,
return a string and we can write our final method.
The encrypts text method is what pulls everything together.
You'll call you normalize text method on the input string.
Call the obify method on the normalized text.
Call the caesarify method on the obify text.
And call the groopify method on the ceasar text.
Print the final encrypted line of text and you're all set.
